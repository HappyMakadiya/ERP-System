# ERP-System
I have tried to work on ERP model and tried to implement in one Informatic, Responsive website for one company.


Targeted Audience:
Who has large and enterprise businesses, as those companies have multiple business divisions with different data and different needs and want to dirt their hand in ERP System. Any One who want to introduce themselves to ERP System.
Target audience can be accessing this site — via their phones, tablets or desktops.


Look and Feel:
Website or application is responsive when it feels decent across all devices: mega-screens, laptops, tablets, and phones. For each screen size, it uses the most effective layout, the visibility and appearance of certain elements can differ, the font sizes and the spacing are relative.
Cover more devices and, hence, more users
Due to the drastic improvement in website design through different tools, animations have been part of that. We’ve tried to create eye-catching websites to create better conversions and attract people to browse, click, and view things on our sites.


Content of Website:
Website of a company who delivers high-performance business modules integrated into customized solution packages for different type of Industry, Datanote for Enterprise and standard edition of ERP Model, various services, products, different pricing model and section for about and contact info.
